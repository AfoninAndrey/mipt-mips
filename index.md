This project is a part of [Intel lab's](http://ilab.fizteh.ru) activity at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](http://phystech.edu/) (MIPT). The project is being developed by a group of students under the guidance of Intel employees.

The aim of the project is to teach the students the computer architecture through development of a microprocessor implementing the [MIPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS32) instruction set in both functional and performance simulators.

## Lectures on Computer Architecture

Here you may find lectures on the computer architecture and simulation practicums of 2016/2017 year.

## MIPT-MIPS Simulator

In our [production repository](https://github.com/MIPT-ILab/mipt-mips) you may find C++ sources required to complete this year course assignments â€” step-by-step implementation of MIPS simulator.

That repo has a lot of useful [Wiki manuals](https://github.com/MIPT-ILab/mipt-mips/wiki) about Git, MIPS, C++, Make utilites and so on.

## About us

The project has been started in 2012 year as part of Intel lab's activity in MIPT. Currently it is mentored by [Pavel Kryukov](https://github.com/pavelkryukov) and [Igor Smirnov](https://github.com/igorsmir-ilab). For more information, check [this wiki page](https://github.com/MIPT-ILab/mipt-mips/wiki/About-Us) and [Intel lab's site](http://ilab.fizteh.ru)
