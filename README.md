### Functional and performance simulators for MIPS-based microprocessor ###

This project is a part of [Intel lab's](http://ilab.fizteh.ru) activity at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](http://phystech.edu/about/aboutmipt.html) (MIPT). The project is being developed by a group of students under the guidance of Intel employees.

The aim of the project is to teach the students the computer architecture through development of a microprocessor implementing the [MIPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS32) instruction set in both functional and performance simulators.
